It supports the following case-insensitive modes. Note that Spark tries to parse only required columns in CSV under column pruning. Therefore, corrupt records can be different based on required set of fields. This behavior can be controlled by spark.sql.csv.parser.columnPruning.enabled (enabled by default).
    
      PERMISSIVE: when it meets a corrupted record, puts the malformed string into a field configured by columnNameOfCorruptRecord, and sets malformed fields to null. To keep corrupt records, an user can set a string type field named columnNameOfCorruptRecord in an user-defined schema. If a schema does not have the field, it drops corrupt records during parsing. A record with less/more tokens than schema is not a corrupted record to CSV. When it meets a record having fewer tokens than the length of the schema, sets null to extra fields. When the record has more tokens than the length of the schema, it drops extra tokens.
      DROPMALFORMED: ignores the whole corrupted records.
      FAILFAST: throws an exception when it meets corrupted records.

      STOP_AT_CLOSING_QUOTE: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, accumulate the quote character and proceed parsing the value as a quoted value, until a closing quote is found.
      BACK_TO_DELIMITER: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, consider the value as an unquoted value. This will make the parser accumulate all characters of the current parsed value until the delimiter is found. If no delimiter is found in the value, the parser will continue accumulating characters from the input until a delimiter or line ending is found.
      STOP_AT_DELIMITER: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, consider the value as an unquoted value. This will make the parser accumulate all characters until the delimiter or a line ending is found in the input.
      SKIP_VALUE: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, the content parsed for the given value will be skipped and the value set in nullValue will be produced instead.
      RAISE_ERROR: If unescaped quotes are found in the input, a TextParsingException will be thrown.
